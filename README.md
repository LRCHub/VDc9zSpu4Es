[00:00.07] Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
[00:03.46] But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
[00:07.52] My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in"
[00:11.91] "Politics, religions or other people's quarrels"
[00:35.91] 
[00:16.75] I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
[00:20.14] I know when I have children, they will know what it means
[00:24.28] And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me
[00:28.25] Just love and understanding, positivity
[00:47.75] 
[00:32.79] We could change this whole world with a piano
[00:36.53] Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
[00:41.88] I'm just a boy with a one-man show
[00:45.03] No university, no degree, but Lord knows
[01:05.03] 
[00:49.68] Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
[00:53.45] And the stock market crashing in their portfolios
[00:57.53] While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
[01:01.77] Saying, "Love could change the world in a moment", but what do I know?
[01:10.67] Love can change the world in a moment, but what do I know?
[01:18.95] Love can change the world in a moment
[01:37.45] 
[01:23.26] The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
[01:26.86] I saw people marching in the streets today
[01:31.85] You know we are made up of love and hate
[01:35.16] But both of them are balanced on a razor blade
[01:58.16] 
[01:40.32] I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
[01:43.69] I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
[01:47.83] Just re-remember life is more than fitting in your jeans
[01:52.05] It's love and understanding, positivity
[02:11.55] 
[01:56.04] We could change this whole world with a piano
[02:00.08] Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
[02:05.23] I'm just a boy with a one-man show
[02:08.62] No university, no degree, but Lord knows
[02:28.62] 
[02:13.24] Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
[02:16.80] And the stock market crashing in their portfolios
[02:21.08] While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
[02:25.17] Saying, "Love could change the world in a moment", but what do I know?
[02:34.12] Love can change the world in a moment, but what do I know?
[02:42.43] Love can change the world in a moment
[03:00.93] 
[02:46.92] I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
[02:50.41] You know the future's in the hands of you and me
[02:54.59] So let's all get together, we can all be free
[02:58.61] Spread love and understanding, positivity
[03:19.11] 
[03:03.03] We could change this whole world with a piano
[03:06.97] Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
[03:12.05] I'm just a boy with a one-man show
[03:15.32] No university, no degree, but Lord knows
[03:35.32] 
[03:20.02] Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
[03:23.68] And the stock market crashing in their portfolios
[03:27.89] While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
[03:31.90] Saying, "Love could change the world in a moment", but what do I know?
[03:40.93] Love can change the world in a moment, but what do I know?
[03:49.36] Love can change the world in a moment, but what do I know?
