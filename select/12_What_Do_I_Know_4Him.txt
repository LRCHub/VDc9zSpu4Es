I make it my firm policy
To make my bed with honesty
So, I don't sleep with shadows in the room
The truth is I've been holdin' back
The way I feel about the fact
That I'm not as close as I want to be with You

There's still so much more of You I long to know
and I won't be content until I do

CHORUS
Cause what do I know
If I don't really know You
Though I may blow the minds of men
How can I say that I know
Anything of love
Unless I find it in Your hands

I'm not playing playground games
I'm not reading Dick and Jane
And I don't need a pass to walk the halls
I've graduated in my faith
And still I've barely pushed the gate
That opens to the one true know-it-all

I could win a nobel prize or rule the world
But, I would die a genius with no clue

REPEAT CHORUS

BRIDGE
Life is such a cruel deception
Without You to lead my quest
I'd fail the test
