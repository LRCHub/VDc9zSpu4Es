You were once my vice, now you're just like ice
So cold and too cool
You know how to hypnotize, you wear a great disguise
I've learned to see through
What do I know, what do I know
I'm confused by the things that you do
What do I know, what do I know
I can't stop thinking about you
I don't see wrong from right, but I could see the light
Stopped shining in you
And on a distant night, you went and lost the fight
That made me look up to you
What do I know, what do I know
I'm confused by the things that you do - I don't know
What do I know, what do I know
I can't stop thinking about you - thinking about you
Thinking about you, you, yeah
What do I know, what do I know
I'm confused by the things that you do - I don't know
What do I know, what do I know
I can't stop thinking about you
Oh, what did you change for, oh
What do I know, what do I know
I'm confused by the things that you do - I'm so confused
What do I know, what do I know
I can't stop thinking about you - thinking about you
What did you change for, no one could give you more
What did you change for, no one could give you more
Thinking about you
What do I know, what do I know
I'm confused by the things that you do - what did you change for
What do I know, what do I know
I can't stop thinking about you - thinking about you
What do I know, what do I know
